.. Project Readme

Introduction
============

Our project and package reads in and cleans regular and postseason NBA data. It then combines them with a dataset that has metrics and a normalized performance score for each player in the regular season and playoffs. Finally, it preforms regression on the curated data to predict a player's playoff performance score.
