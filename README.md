# Stat386Project

This is Sam Wise and Matthew Ng's Project on NBA Player Performance comparing regular to postseason.

Link to Documentation: samthemanwise.github.io/Stat386Project

Our raw data for regular player information (Team, age, etc) came from:
https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2022_advanced.html
https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA_2022_advanced.html

To get our player metrics (RAPTOR, PREDATOR, WAR) we pulled data that was already curated from:
