# Stat386Project

This is Sam Wise and Matthew Ng's Project investigating NBA Player Performance comparing regular to postseason. We want to see if we can create a good performance metric that we can also use to predict postseason performance.

This repository includes...

- requirements.txt and setup.py 

- All of the raw data files we used and the final curated datasets. 

- Two .py files that our package modules were built on that scrape/clean data and wrangle data. 

- Some .ipynb and .py files that were used to perform our regression, create demos, and a workspace to code in.
